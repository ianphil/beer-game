# Beer Game Facilitator Cheat Sheet

## Quick Setup (15 minutes)

### Game Board Setup

- **4 positions per team**: Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory
- **Initial inventory**: 12 cases at each position
- **Shipping delays**: 4 cases in each delay box (2 weeks total)
- **Order slips**: Place "4" slips face-down in all order boxes
- **Customer cards**: Weeks 1-50, face down showing week numbers

### Team Setup

- Teams pick brewery names
- Distribute record sheets (1 per position)
- Collect ante ($1 per player recommended)
- **Critical**: Emphasize NO COMMUNICATION between positions

## Customer Demand Pattern

- **Weeks 1-4**: 4 cases/week
- **Week 5 onward**: 8 cases/week
- **Keep secret** from all players except retailers

## Game Flow Management

### Call Out Each Step Clearly

1. **"Receive inventory"** - Move beer from delays to inventory
2. **"Fill orders"** - Process incoming orders, update backlog
3. **"Record"** - Write down inventory/backlog on record sheet
4. **"Advance slips"** - Move order slips through delays
5. **"Place orders"** - Make ordering decisions (ONLY decision step)

### Critical Interventions

#### Week 8-9: Backlog Crisis

- **STOP THE GAME** when retailers first get backlog
- Explain backlog mechanics to everyone:
  - "Orders to fill = New orders + Backlog from last week"
  - Backlog is cumulative and costs $1.00/case/week
  - Must fill backlog + new orders if possible
- Write formula on board, check understanding

#### Pace Management

- First few weeks: Go SLOW, ensure mechanics understood
- Tell everyone to order 4 cases initially
- Display current week number prominently
- Keep teams synchronized

## End Game (Week 36)

### Immediate Steps

1. Calculate costs: `(Inventory × $0.50) + (Backlog × $1.00)`
2. Determine winning team (lowest total cost)
3. Distribute graphs:
   - Orders graph (all positions)
   - Effective Inventory graph (all positions)  
   - Customer Order sketch (wholesaler, distributor, factory only)

### During Break

- Calculate final scores
- Tape graphs together for display
- Prepare for debriefing

## Debriefing Script (40+ minutes)

### Phase 1: Experience (10 minutes)

**Ask**: "What was your experience playing this game?"

- Did you feel at the mercy of forces in the system?
- Did you blame other positions for your problems?

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (15 minutes)

**Show graphs, ask**: "What patterns do you see across teams?"

- Point out common oscillations despite different individuals
- **Key insight**: Structure produces behavior, not individual differences

### Phase 3: The Big Reveal (15 minutes)

**Ask non-retailers**: "What do you think customers were ordering?"

- Most assume fluctuating demand
- **Reveal**: Simple step from 4 to 8 cases
- **Show contrast**: Tiny demand change vs. huge order oscillations
- **Core lesson**: Internal structure, not external events, causes behavior

## Materials Checklist

### Per Team

- [ ] Game board
- [ ] 500-600 chips (cases)
- [ ] Customer order cards (50 weeks)
- [ ] 200 order slips
- [ ] 4 record sheets
- [ ] 4 pencils
- [ ] 4 colored markers
- [ ] 2 calculators

### Per Session

- [ ] Flip chart/whiteboard
- [ ] Masking tape
- [ ] Extra blank order slips
- [ ] Graph sheets (print 4 sets per team)

## Time Budget

- **Setup**: 15 minutes
- **Game**: 90 minutes (36 weeks)
- **Graphing**: 15 minutes
- **Debriefing**: 40+ minutes
- **Total**: ~2.5 hours

## Troubleshooting

- **Players communicate**: Remind of no-communication rule
- **Confusion about backlog**: Re-explain cumulative nature
- **Pace too fast**: Slow down, check understanding
- **End-game behavior**: Don't reveal 36-week endpoint until after
